# Project UdaciCards

This project showcases my React Native knowledge and applies it to a flashcards app that allows users to create decks and quiz themselves.  While this code can run on both iOS and Android, I have developed this specifically for Android.

## Technologies Used
This app was made through _create-react-native-app_, but also uses boilerplate code generated from _ignite_.  It uses AsyncStorage for persisting data and uses Redux to store the global state of the decks.  Expo's notifications are scheduled to run at 6:30 pm everyday to remind the user to quiz themselves if they haven't opened the app already

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
